# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 29 December 2016

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100 Days of Code and updated outdated WooCommerce files on thecleft.org

**Thoughts:** Pretty boring work. I'm fairly confident that I have more files than needed duplicated, but they are all updated

### Day 2: 30 December 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started working on As Heard On plugin and I fixed the bug that the data wasn't be deleted from the database.

**Thoughts**: Looking at the code, I'm impressed I was able to modify a Testimonial plugin to get it to work like it has. There's a lot to refactor and make the code simpler.
